Windows 7 Forensics Documentation

1. Event Log Analysis for Brute Force Attacks
Tools Used: Windows Event Viewer, PowerShell,

Steps Documented:

Simulated Attack:
Performed brute-force attempts using Hydra against Windows 7 RDP.

(used command)
hydra -t 4 -V -f -l admin -P rockyou.txt rdp://192.168.21.3
Artifacts Analyzed:

Located failed login events in Security.evtx (Event ID 4625).
Identified source IP and timestamp patterns.

Detection Rule Created:

<------------PowerShell snippet to flag 5+ failed logins in 10 minutes------>
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4625} | 
  Group-Object -Property {$_.Properties[19].Value} | 
  Where-Object {$_.Count -gt 5}

2. Basic Malware Artifact Hunting
Tools Used: Autoruns, Process Explorer, Wireshark

Techniques Tested:

Persistence Mechanisms:
Scanned HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run for suspicious entries.

Process Analysis:
Used Process Explorer to identify rogue processes (e.g., svchost.exe spoofing).

Findings:
Fake explorer.exe process observed with unsigned DLLs. Network traffic showed beaconing to Russian IP (VT score: 85/100).

Remediation Tested:

Quarantined files with Microsoft Safety Scanner.
Rebuilt compromised registry keys.
