1. Weak Credential Identification
Tools Used: Hydra, John the Ripper, Metasploit
Steps Documented:

Scanned for open SSH ports with nmap -p 22 171.69.21.1

Ran brute-force attack:

bash
Copy
hydra -l admin -P rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.171.69.21.1 -t 4 -vV  
Finding: Default creds msfadmin:msfadmin granted full access.

Remediation Tested:

Enforced password complexity policies.

Implemented fail2ban to block brute-force attempts.

2. Service Hardening (FTP/SMB)
Vulnerabilities Exploited:

Anonymous FTP Access:

Used ftp 171.69.21.1 → logged in anonymously → exfiltrated dummy files.

SMB Misconfiguration:

Exploited with Metasploit’s exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script.

Remediation Steps:

FTP:

Disabled anonymous login in /etc/vsftpd.conf.

Enabled TLS encryption.

SMB:

Updated Samba to latest version.

Restricted shares to authorized users only.

Key Learning:

Misconfigured services often provide initial access. Patching and access controls are critical for aviation ground systems (e.g., baggage handling IT).
